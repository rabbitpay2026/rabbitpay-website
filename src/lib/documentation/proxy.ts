 * Serve one documentation page from this origin.

 * returned as this site's own — so the browser's address bar never changes and
 * no cross-domain redirect is involved. The upstream deployment is only ever
 * read: nothing here alters it, and `docs.rabbitpay.ai` keeps serving exactly
 * as it does today, on its own domain, for anyone who goes there directly.
 *
 * This is a proxy rather than a rewrite in `next.config.ts` for one reason: a
 * rewrite returns the upstream body verbatim, and a verbatim body is the one
 * thing that cannot work. The documentation is published at the root of its own
 * host, so its links and its React payload are full of root-relative paths;
 * handed to a browser sitting on `/documentation` they point at pages this site
 * does not have — or, for `/product` and `/support`, at marketing pages that
 * are not the documentation at all. The body has to be translated, which means
 * it has to be read. `./upstream.ts` holds the translation.
 *
 * Both route files under `app/documentation` are one line each and call this:
 * `/documentation` itself, and everything nested beneath it.
