/**
 * Rewriting React's streaming payload without breaking it.
 *
 * A documentation page arrives with its content twice: once as HTML, and once
 * as the React payload the page hydrates from and the client router navigates
 * by. Both have to be translated into this site's addresses — the HTML so the
 * page renders correct links, the payload so a *click* on one of them goes to
 * the right place instead of leaving `/documentation`.
 *
 * The payload cannot be treated as text and search-replaced. It is a stream of
 * rows, and some rows declare their own length:
 *
 *     36:T9e0,{"@context":"https://schema.org", … }
 *     ↑  ↑ ↑
 *     │  │ └── 0x9e0 bytes of content follow, with no delimiter after them
 *     │  └──── row type: T, a length-prefixed text blob
 *     └─────── row id
 *
 * The next row begins at exactly that offset. So making a string inside one of
 * those rows longer — which `https://docs.rabbitpay.ai` →
 * `https://rabbitpay.ai/documentation` does, by nine bytes each time — moves
 * every subsequent row out from under its own header. React then reads a row as
 * the wrong type and the page dies during hydration with a message about the
 * payload rather than about the URL that caused it.
 *
 * This module therefore walks the stream a row at a time, hands each row's
 * content to the caller's transform, and re-emits length-prefixed rows with
 * their length recomputed. Callers cannot corrupt the stream by changing the
 * size of what they return, which is the whole point.
 *
 * ── On byte offsets ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The declared length counts *bytes*, not characters, so every string here is
 * the body's Latin-1 view: one character per byte, whatever the real encoding
 * is. Non-ASCII text passes through untouched and is written back out byte for
 * byte, and the offsets stay honest. `proxy.ts` is what establishes that view.

 * re-emitted with the length its transformed content actually has.
