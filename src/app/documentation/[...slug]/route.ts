 * Every documentation page below the front one.

 * A catch-all because the documentation nests to whatever depth its authors
 * choose — `/documentation/getting-started/introduction`,
 * `/documentation/integrations/…` — and this site does not hold the list. The
 * slug is handed to the proxy as the path to request upstream, so a page
 * published in the documentation is reachable here the moment it exists, with
 * no change to this repository.
 *
 * See `proxyDocumentation` for how the addresses are translated.
