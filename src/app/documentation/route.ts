/**
 * The documentation's own front page, at `rabbitpay.ai/documentation`.
 *
 * Its nested pages are served by the catch-all beside this file. The two are
 * separate route files rather than one optional catch-all because Next derives
 * its route types from the file tree, and an optional catch-all registers only
 * its bracketed form — which would leave the literal `/documentation` unusable
 * as a checked route in `data/navigation.ts` and in every link to it.
 *
 * Both files defer to `proxyDocumentation`, which is where the whole
 * arrangement is explained.
